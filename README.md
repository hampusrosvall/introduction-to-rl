# Reinforcement Learning 

Repository of my implementations of various algorithms used to solve RL problems. 

The code used in this repository is mainly from the course in RL available at www.udemy.com offered by TheLazyProgrammer. 

The repository contains implemenation of prediction and control algorithm using: 

1) Dynamic programming 
2) Monte Carlo methods 
3) Temporal Difference 


This repository is for self-educational purposes only.
